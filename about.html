        <h1>About Sustainable Stems</h1><br><br>
        <h2>Our mission is to help turn your living space into a happy, peaceful hideaway while using our planet's resources responsibly.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by! Sustainable Stems was created in 2018 by me, Diane Furlong. For a while now, I have had an interest in plants- specifically succulents. I started out with a few plants at my desk. Three years and about 20 clippings later (thanks to co-workers), people would walk by my desk and ask, “is this the lab garden?” Why, yes, yes it is!
          <br><br>
        Having a little bit of nature inside of the office and inside the home brings me a sense of happiness. How can something so simple change the whole vibe of a space? I don’t know, but I want to share the simple pleasure of peacefulness, rejuvenation, and happiness that plants bring me. It’s something so easy, yet makes such a difference.
        <br><br>
        So, this is how Sustainable Stems came about! I decided to take my passion and use it to help others. If everyone started their day off in a room filled with greenery, a peaceful essence, maybe that could be the small impact that makes their day great. Maybe that pleasant feeling of tranquility can resonate throughout their whole day.
        <br><br>
        This is what my hope is for you, and for all.
        <br><br>
        Thanks again for visiting Sustainable Stems! Being a company in the early, budding stages (yes, lame pun intended), every visit to the site is a huge accomplishment and is very much appreciated. Feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a> with any questions, concerns, or comments.
